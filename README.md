# Vision: 
# To provide an easy to use platform that allows users to access information to video games as well as purchase the game itself.

# Mission: 
# Our team will work together to understand the collective goals and desired features of our video game review site. We will divide up the features individually when possible and group up on other features when necessary. We will consistently communicate through Teams & through email outside of our meeting times. During those meetings we plan to discuss what we've accomplished, what we still need to do and how we will do it. We will develop and consistently update a time table for this project that includes group goals as well as individual assessments.

# Success Criteria: 
# Users will be able to easily locate the game they are searching for as well as important information regarding the purchase and product.
