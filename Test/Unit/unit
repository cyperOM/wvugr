We are going to test the following units:
 -Registering and a proper email is given
 -Registering and giving an error for a duplicate username
 -Posting a comment not registered vs posting a comment while registered
 -Testing the registration processes like proper password length of 8, a special character, and a capital letter is included
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Testing:
 -I went into the register page and tried to put in an email without an @ symbol, domain, and a . included
  Expected result:
  give an error if one or all of these things are missing
  Actual result:
  expected result, picture of errors in unit folder
 
 -I went into the register page and tried to put a password in that was not 8 length nor did it have a capital letter or special character and then tried one with those
  Expected result:
  give an error if the requirements are not met
  Actual result: 
  expected result, password worked when requirements were met and gave an error when they were not met. Picture of error message given in unit folder.
  
  -Went to register and tried a duplicate username
  Expected result:
  Give an error message if it is duplicate, if not be able to use username.
  Actual result:
  Expected result, picture of error message in unit folder
  
 -Tried going to a review and try to make a comment
 Expected result: 
 Show message that says need to register before commenting, if registered be able to comment on review
 Actual result:
 Expected results, Picture of error message when not signed in shown in picture in unit folder 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 After running the tests on the registration process and the commenting process, I can conclude all tests were passed and the all results were expected.
 Therefore, the website passed all the unit tests ran.
