Because this website utilizes Wordpress and was therefore constructed differently, our testing process is much
different than other groups.  We found very little in the way of automated testing.  

Our testing process included...
-defining the purpose of the test
-the criteria that would need to be met in order to pass the test
-the process of walking through and verifying that the criteria is met

Two images are included that display the results of two automated tests.  One of them was an overall test of our 
website and the other checked the integrity of the files of our website.  

The member contributions to each test are shown below:
Automated Overall Test - Mohammed
Automated File Integrity Test - Mohammed
Unit Test - 
Integration Test - 
Validation Test - Anthony
