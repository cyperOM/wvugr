We are going to validate that the requirement described on our CRC card is still met. 
The requirement is as follows:

“As a user, I want an overall review of the game (accompanied with a rating of 0-5 stars) 
so that I can quickly see the author's overall opinion of the game as well as read about the good and bad details.”

We are going to validate this by: 
-logging into an account made from previous tests 
-confirm that each game has a comprehensive review
-confirm that each game has a 0-5 star rating
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I logged in under the following credentials...
Username: 
Password:

I then went on to each individual game and checked for the following items:
-a comprehensive review of the game
-a 0-5 star rating

After looking at each game, I concluded that this requirements were met.

Therefore, the website fully passes this validation test.
