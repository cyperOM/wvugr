We are going to validate that the requirement described on our CRC card is still met. 
The requirement is as follows:

“As a user, I want an overall review of the game (accompanied with a rating of 0-5 stars) 
so that I can quickly see the author's overall opinion of the game as well as read about the good and bad details.”
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are going to validate this by: 
-logging into a non-admin account made from previous tests 
-confirm that each game has a comprehensive review
-confirm that each game has a 0-5 star rating
-confirm that the non-admin user is unable to post review

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I logged in under the following credentials...
Username: milestone5
Password: Cs230milestone5!

I then went on to each individual game and checked for the following items:
-a comprehensive review of the game
-a 0-5 star rating

As this user, which was not an admin, I was unable to post a review to the website.

After looking at each game, I concluded that these requirements were met.

Therefore, the website fully passes this validation test.
